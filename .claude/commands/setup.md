  Please read and analyze both the project-specific CLAUDE.md file (if it exists in the current working directory or project
  root) and my global/personal CLAUDE.md file (typically located in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md or similar user configuration
  directory). It's okay if these files do not exist.

  CLAUDE FILE LOCATIONS
  Global:
    @~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
  Project:
    @./CLAUDE.md


  After reading both files, confirm your understanding about the current application by learning about the file structure of the application, what certain parts of the application currently do, and past work that has been done (look at the last 3-5 commits).

  After doing all of that:

  1. **Summarize the key guidelines** from the files, their rules and information should be combined.
  2. **Handle Conflicts** between the guidelines in the two files by always defering to the project CLAUDE.md instead of the gloabl CLAUDE.md
  3. **Confirm your understanding** of the combined instruction set that should govern our work session
  4. **Explain previous work** done and how it ties into the current state of the application

  If either file doesn't exist or isn't accessible, please inform me and proceed with whatever guidelines are available.
  Prioritize project-specific instructions when they conflict with global ones, unless the global instructions explicitly
  override project settings.

  Present your findings in a clear, organized format so that you can reference them in the future without needing to reopen the files.
